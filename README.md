# Final Project AI (IT and MAP Constraints)

This is a final project for AI in 2025, completed by Vamsi S and Sukhbir S.

## Overview

The Final Project AI (IT and MAP Constraints) is a comprehensive application that addresses two AI-related problems: IT scheduling and Map Coloring. It consists of a backend server built with Node.js and Express, integrated with Python algorithms for solving scheduling and coloring problems, and a frontend React application for user interaction.

## Project Structure

- **backend/**: Contains the server-side logic, including routes for users, finals, and shifts. It also includes Python implementations for:
  - **Scheduling/**: Algorithms for scheduling finals using CSP, Genetic Algorithm, and Simulated Annealing.
  - **Map_Coloring/**: Algorithms for map coloring using CSP, Genetic Algorithm, and Simulated Annealing, along with a dedicated HTML frontend interface.

- **frontend/**: A React-based user interface for managing users, viewing schedules, and interacting with the application.

- **server/**: The main Node.js server with models and routes.

## Detailed READMEs

For more precise information on each problem and their implementations, please refer to the README files in the respective backend folders:

- [IT Scheduling README](backend/Scheduling/README.md)
- [Map Coloring README](backend/Map_Coloring/README-MAPCOLORING.md)

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Node.js and Python installed.
2. Install dependencies for the backend and frontend using `npm install`.
3. Run the backend server and frontend application as per the instructions in the detailed READMEs.
